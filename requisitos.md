Generate the code for a modern and professional Single Page Application (SPA), focused on usability and user experience (UI/UX), for an internet café called "Ciber Click". The design should be simple, attractive, and responsive, using the Astro framework and the utility-first framework Tailwind CSS.

🎨 Color Palette
The main color palette to be used should be the following, incorporating these colors meaningfully into the design (buttons, section backgrounds, accents, etc.):

Primary/Accent: #0f71f9 (Vibrant Blue)

Background/Secondary: #d2d2d0 (Light Gray/Almost White)

Success/Notification: #00ef00 (Bright Green)

Warning/Secondary Accent: #cc7c00 (Orange/Amber)

Text/Details: #696c6b (Dark Gray)

🧱 Section Structure
The page should be a single page divided into the following sections, with smooth scrolling between them and fixed navigation:

Header/Fixed Navigation: With the "Cyber ​​Click" logo and links to all sections.

Homepage (Hero):

Eye-catching title: "Cyber ​​Click: Digital and Technical Solutions in One Place."

Concise description of the main services.

A prominent call-to-action (CTA) button directing to the Contact or Services/Products section.

Products and Services:

Clear subsections for:

Printing and Copying: (Color, Black & White, Scanning).

Technical Services: (Computer Repair and Maintenance, Printer Maintenance, Cell Phone Repair).

Use Tailwind cards with icons or small illustrations for each service, highlighting the prices of the most common services (e.g., black & white copying, color printing).

Advertising/Offers (Callout):

A dedicated section to highlight a limited-time promotion or a featured service (e.g., "50% off printer maintenance!"). Use the color #00ef00 or #cc7c00 to create contrast and a sense of urgency.

Reviews/Testimonials:

A carousel or grid of 3-4 fictional testimonials highlighting the quality, speed, and professionalism of the service.

Contact and Location (Footer):

Simple contact form (Name, Email, Message).

Contact information (Phone, Address).

Space for an embedded map (placeholder).

⚙️ Implementation Requirements
Frameworks: Use Astro for the component structure and Tailwind CSS for all styling.

Style: The design should convey trust, modernity, and efficiency. Soft shadows, rounded corners, and clean (sans-serif) typography are suggested.

Animation: Include subtle hover micro-interactions on buttons and cards, and fade-in or slide-up animations on scrolling to enhance the user experience.

Design: Implement a mobile-first design to ensure excellent performance and responsiveness.
